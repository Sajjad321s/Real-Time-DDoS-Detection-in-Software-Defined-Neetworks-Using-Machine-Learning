Selected the CICIoT2023 dataset for this experiment due to its extensive topology, featuring 105 IoT devices and 47 attributes. Proposed an efficient machine learning model using effective feature selection, reducing the modelâ€™s complexity by just selecting only 3 features out of 47, in the most efficient way. Additionally, conducted real-time DDoS detection experiments in SDN networks using Mininet and the Ryu controller, successfully generating and validating datasets in real-time and also being able to detect DDoS attacks within minimal capabilities.
